## Copywriting Frameworks

### The "So What?!" Formula (GuestHook)

Transform features into emotional benefits by asking "So what?" until you reach the feeling:

| Feature | So What? | So What?! | Emotional Payoff |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| 70ft dock | Can dock your boat | No marina fees | Wake up, walk 10 steps, and be fishing |
| Heated pool | Swim year-round | Kids stay entertained | More relaxation time for parents |
| 500 Mbps WiFi | Fast internet | Can work remotely | Extend your vacation guilt-free |
| Chef's kitchen | Can cook meals | Save money on dining | Cook with your family like you're home |

### PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**Structure**:
1. **Problem**: Identify guest pain point
2. **Agitate**: Emphasize what they're missing
3. **Solution**: Your property solves it

**Example**:
> Tired of vacation rentals that promise waterfront but deliver a distant glimpse of water? (Problem) You've scrolled through hundreds of listings, only to arrive and find the "ocean view" requires binoculars. (Agitate) At Blue Pearl, step from your bedroom directly onto a 70-foot dock where dolphins swim by during your morning coffee. (Solution)

### AIDA Framework (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**Structure**:
1. **Attention**: Hook with unique feature
2. **Interest**: Expand with benefits
3. **Desire**: Paint the experience
4. **Action**: Clear booking CTA

**Example**:
> **Attention**: 70 feet of dock, zero bridges to the ocean.
> **Interest**: This is what fishing vacations in the Keys are made of—deep-water access, no navigation hassles, and tarpon that swim right past your morning coffee spot.
> **Desire**: Imagine casting a line at sunrise without leaving your backyard, then grilling your catch on the outdoor kitchen while the kids splash in the heated pool.
> **Action**: Book direct and save 15-20% on your Florida Keys escape.

## Hook Formulas (First 50 Characters)

The first 50 characters determine if guests read more. Use these proven formulas:

### Formula 1: Location + Feature
```
"Waterfront Marathon home with 70ft dock & pool"
```

### Formula 2: Benefit-Led
```
"Wake up 10 steps from the ocean every morning"
```

### Formula 3: Numbered Value
```
"4 beds, heated pool, 75ft dock—all waterfront"
```

### Formula 4: Experience-Focused
```
"Fish from your backyard, swim in your pool"
```

### Formula 5: Emotional Hook
```
"The Florida Keys escape you've been dreaming of"
```

## Power Words vs Weak Words

| Weak (Generic) | Power (Specific) | Example |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Nice | Stunning | Stunning sunset views from the dock |
| Big | Spacious / 2,400 sqft | Spacious 2,400 sqft open floor plan |
| Good | Exceptional | Exceptional chef's kitchen |
| New | Recently renovated | Recently renovated with luxury finishes |
| Near | Steps from / 5-minute walk | Steps from Sombrero Beach |
| Beautiful | Breathtaking | Breathtaking canal views |
| Great | Unmatched | Unmatched waterfront access |

## Emotional Triggers for Vacation Bookings

| Trigger | Application | Example Copy |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Escape** | Stress relief | "Leave the mainland behind" |
| **Connection** | Family/friends | "Room for the whole crew" |
| **Experience** | Memory-making | "Stories you'll tell for years" |
| **Comfort** | Home-away-from-home | "Everything you need, nothing you don't" |
| **Status** | Luxury/exclusivity | "Your private waterfront estate" |
| **FOMO** | Scarcity | "Calendar filling fast for [season]" |
| **Value** | Direct booking savings | "Save 15-20% vs Airbnb/VRBO" |
