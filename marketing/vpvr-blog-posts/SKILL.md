## 2025/26 Search Reality

The search landscape has fundamentally shifted:

| Search Type | 2023 | 2025/26 |
|-------------|------|---------|
| **Traditional Google** | 90% | 65% |
| **AI Overviews** | 0% | 25% |
| **Voice Search** | 5% | 15% |
| **Direct Answers** | 5% | 20% |

### What This Means for VPVR

> "If your content isn't structured for AI extraction, you're invisible to 40% of searchers."

**Required Approach**: Every blog post must be optimized for:
1. Traditional SEO (rankings)
2. Featured snippets (position zero)
3. AI Overview citations (new traffic source)
4. Voice search answers (conversational queries)

---

## HubSpot's 5-Step AEO Framework

### Step 1: Understand Searcher Intent

Before writing, classify the query intent:

| Intent Type | Example Query | Content Approach |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Informational** | "best fishing spots in Marathon" | Comprehensive guide with details |
| **Navigational** | "Villa Paraiso vacation rentals" | Brand + service pages |
| **Commercial** | "Marathon vacation rentals with pool" | Property listings + comparison |
| **Transactional** | "book vacation rental Marathon FL" | Direct conversion pages |

### Step 2: Create Question-Focused Content

Structure content around actual questions:

**Research questions via**:
- Google "People Also Ask" boxes
- AlsoAsked.com
- AnswerThePublic
- Google Autosuggest

**H2 headers should BE questions**:
- ❌ "Fishing in Marathon"
- ✅ "What Fish Can You Catch in Marathon FL?"

### Step 3: Structure for Featured Snippets

Three snippet formats to target:

| Snippet Type | Best For | Structure |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Paragraph** | "What is..." "Why does..." | 40-60 word direct answer immediately after H2 |
| **List** | "How to..." "Best..." "Top..." | Numbered or bulleted list (5-10 items) |
| **Table** | "Comparison" "vs" "prices" | 3-5 column table with clear headers |

### Step 4: Use Conversational Language

Voice search optimization requires natural language:

**Traditional keyword**: "fishing spots Marathon FL"
**Voice query**: "Where's the best place to fish in Marathon Florida?"

**Write for how people SPEAK, not type.**

### Step 5: Optimize for AI Extraction

AI systems extract answers differently:

- **First 100 words**: Must contain a complete, standalone answer
- **Clear definitions**: "X is..." format for terms
- **Structured data**: Lists, tables, clear headings
- **Citations needed**: Link to authoritative sources
