## Content Pillars

### Distribution: 40/30/20/10 Rule

| Pillar | % | Purpose |
|--------|---|---------|
| **Industry Insights** | 40% | Establish expertise, attract attention |
| **Florida Keys Market** | 30% | Local authority, owner targeting |
| **Business Building** | 20% | Relatability, leadership credibility |
| **Direct Value (Owner-Focused)** | 10% | Soft CTA, lead generation |

---

## Pillar 1: Industry Insights (40%)

Position Michel as an industry expert who sees what others miss.

### Topics
- Vacation rental market trends
- Airbnb/VRBO policy changes
- Short-term rental regulations
- Technology and AI in property management
- Industry data and what it means
- Predictions and contrarian takes

### Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Data Reveal** | "I analyzed 500 bookings. The data surprised me:" |
| **Industry Secret** | "Most property managers won't tell you this:" |
| **Trend Alert** | "The vacation rental industry just shifted. Here's what it means:" |
| **Prediction** | "This is where vacation rentals are headed in 2027:" |
| **Myth Bust** | "The biggest lie in vacation rental management:" |

### Example Post

```
I analyzed 500 bookings across our Keys portfolio.

Here's what I found:

The average booking window (how far out guests book) dropped from 45 days to 28 days.

What this means for property owners:

1. Your pricing strategy needs to be more dynamic (adjusting weekly, not monthly)
2. Last-minute availability isn't a problem - it's an opportunity
3. "Slow season" doesn't mean what it used to

The old playbook: set rates for the season, wait for bookings.
The new playbook: adjust daily based on demand signals.

This shift rewards active management.
It punishes set-it-and-forget-it.

Are you seeing this in your market?

## Pillar 2: Florida Keys Market (30%)

Establish Michel as THE local expert for Keys vacation rentals.

### Topics
- Marathon/Middle Keys market analysis
- Keys-specific regulations and challenges
- Hurricane season reality
- Seasonal patterns unique to the Keys
- Local insights only residents know
- Comparison to other markets

### Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Local Authority** | "After 6 years managing properties in Marathon:" |
| **Location Unique** | "The Florida Keys market is unlike anywhere else." |
| **Insider Truth** | "Property owners ask me about hurricane season. Here's the truth:" |
| **Data + Local** | "Keys vacation rentals in Q1: here's what the numbers show:" |
| **Comparison** | "Why the Keys outperform Miami Beach for vacation rentals:" |

### Example Post

```
"Is hurricane season really that bad for bookings?"

Property owners ask me this constantly.

Here's the truth after 6 years in Marathon:

❌ The fear: September/October = ghost town
✅ The reality: It's more nuanced

Yes, August-October sees lower demand.
But here's what most don't know:

→ Fishing is EXCEPTIONAL during this period
→ Rates drop, but serious anglers still book
→ October is often better than August
→ The guests who come are the best guests (experienced Keys travelers)

Our portfolio last September:
- 58% occupancy (vs 75% high season)
- Higher ADR than August
- Zero weather-related cancellations

Hurricane season is priced in.
Smart owners use this time for:
- Maintenance
- Upgrades
- Photography refresh

The worst thing you can do? Close your property entirely.

Any Keys property owners here? What's your experience been?

## Pillar 3: Business Building (20%)

Share authentic leadership lessons and vulnerability.

### Topics
- Lessons from starting VPVR
- Mistakes and what they taught
- Hiring and team building
- Customer service philosophy
- Work-life balance in hospitality
- Entrepreneurship reality

### Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Mistake Reveal** | "I made a $15,000 mistake my first year:" |
| **Almost Quit** | "I almost quit property management in year 2. Here's what changed:" |
| **Hard Truth** | "The hardest lesson I've learned as a business owner:" |
| **Decision Point** | "The best decision I made for my business (that felt risky at the time):" |
| **Vulnerability** | "I don't share this often, but:" |

### Example Post

```
I made a $15,000 mistake my first year.

I said yes to a property that wasn't right for our portfolio.

The owner wanted things done their way.
We wanted to deliver a certain experience.
We both meant well.
But we weren't aligned.

Six months and $15,000 in lessons later, we parted ways.

What I learned:

Not every property (or client) is right for your business.

The best partnerships start with honest conversations about expectations.

Now, before we take on a new property:
→ 90-minute alignment call
→ Clear discussion of our approach
→ Their goals vs. what we can deliver
→ Written expectations before we sign

It's saved us from several more expensive lessons.

What's a business mistake that taught you something valuable?

## Pillar 4: Direct Owner Value (10%)

Provide actionable value that positions VPVR as the obvious choice.

### Topics
- Property management checklist items
- How to evaluate a manager
- ROI optimization tips
- Common owner mistakes
- Choosing the right property for rental
- Direct booking strategies

### Hook Formulas

| **Warning Signs** | "Red flags your property manager isn't performing:" |
| **ROI Reveal** | "I increased one owner's revenue by 40%. Here's how:" |
| **Mistake Prevention** | "The #1 mistake new vacation rental owners make:" |
| **Value Ladder** | "If I could only give new owners one piece of advice:" |

### Example Post

```
Your property manager should do these 5 things every week:

1. Physically inspect your property (not just after guests leave)
2. Send you photos of the property condition
3. Monitor your pricing against local competition
4. Respond to guest inquiries within 1 hour
5. Check and respond to your reviews

If they're not?

You're leaving money (and peace of mind) on the table.

At Villa Paraiso, this is standard.

Because it's what I'd want if it were my property.
