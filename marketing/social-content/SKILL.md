---

## Mode 1: Video Script Creation

### The 4-Step Video Structure

Every high-performing short-form video follows this pattern:

```
HOOK (0-3 sec)      →  Pattern interrupt, stop the scroll
VALUE DROP (3-10 sec) →  Promise or setup that creates curiosity
STORY/PAYOFF (10-45 sec) →  Deliver on the promise
CTA (last 3-5 sec)   →  Clear, single action
```

### 5 Proven Hook Formulas (Conor Eliot)

| Formula | Structure | VPVR Example |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Contrarian** | "Stop doing X..." | "Stop booking beach hotels. Here's what smart travelers do instead." |
| **Mistake** | "This mistake cost me..." | "This mistake ruined my Florida vacation. Don't do this in the Keys." |
| **Numbered List** | "3 things you need..." | "3 things every Keys vacation MUST include (number 2 is non-negotiable)" |
| **Time-Based** | "In 10 seconds..." | "In 10 seconds, I'll show you why this dock is worth the flight." |
| **Question** | "Why do so many..." | "Why do so many travelers overpay for Keys vacations?" |

### Visual Hook Types (Shannon McKinstrie 3-Second Rule)

The visual MUST match the verbal hook:

| Hook Type | Visual Treatment | Example |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Motion** | Start mid-action | Walking onto dock, jumping in pool |
| **Reveal** | Hide then show | Pan from dark room to water view |
| **Text Pop** | Bold text overlay | "70FT DOCK" appearing dramatically |
| **Face-to-Camera** | Direct eye contact | Host speaking directly to viewer |
| **POV** | First-person view | "POV: You just arrived at your Keys vacation" |

- **Best Posting Time**: Tuesday 7 PM ET
```

---

## Mode 2: Copy Optimization

### Caption Formula (Gary Vee Jab-Jab-Right Hook)

Most posts = JAB (value, entertainment, connection)
Occasional posts = RIGHT HOOK (ask/sell)

**Jab Ratio**: 4 value posts : 1 promotional post

### The PASE Caption Framework

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **P**roblem/Pattern Interrupt | Stop the scroll | "Everyone's fighting for beach chairs..." |
| **A**gitate/Amplify | Create emotional connection | "...while you could have a private pool, dock, and your own slice of the Keys." |
| **S**olution/Story | Your value proposition | "Blue Pearl: 4 bedrooms, heated pool, 70ft dock, zero crowds." |
| **E**ngage/Exit | CTA + engagement trigger | "What would you do first - pool or fishing? 👇" |

### Hook Optimization Examples

**Before (Weak)**:
"Blue Pearl is our newest 4-bedroom property in Marathon!"

**After (Contrarian Hook)**:
"Stop booking beach resorts. Here's what smart travelers do instead..."

**After (Question Hook)**:
"What if your vacation rental had 70 feet of private dock?"

**After (Numbered Hook)**:
"3 reasons Marathon rentals beat Miami Beach (number 2 is why we moved here)"

### Engagement Triggers (Jasmine Star Framework)

Every caption should include ONE engagement trigger:

| Trigger Type | Example | When to Use |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **This or That** | "Pool day or fishing day? 🎣 or 🏊" | Property showcases |
| **Tag Someone** | "Tag your fishing buddy" | Lifestyle/activity content |
| **Save for Later** | "Save this for your Keys trip planning" | Tips, guides, local recs |
| **Hot Take** | "Unpopular opinion: [statement]" | Destination content |
| **Question** | "What's your must-have vacation amenity?" | Any content |
| **Fill in Blank** | "The best thing about Keys vacations is ___" | Community building |

### Hashtag Strategy 2025/26

**Key Shift**: Fewer hashtags, more strategic placement

| Platform | Optimal Count | Strategy |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Instagram | 3-5 | Niche + location (in caption, not comments) |
| TikTok | 3-5 | Mix trending + niche |
| Facebook | 1-2 | Location only |

**VPVR Core Hashtags** (rotate, don't use all):

*Always Include (pick 1-2)*:
`#FloridaKeys` `#MarathonFL` `#KeysLife`

*Niche (pick 2-3)*:
`#KeysFishing` `#VacationRental` `#WaterfrontLiving` `#PrivateDock` `#PoolVibes`

*Avoid* (oversaturated, no reach):
`#Travel` `#Vacation` `#Beautiful` `#Paradise` `#Blessed`

## Mode 4: Platform Adaptation

### Instagram (Reels-First Strategy)

**Content Priority**:
1. Reels (70% of posts) - Maximum reach
2. Carousels (20%) - High saves, good reach
3. Static (10%) - Announcements, quotes

**Reel Specs**:
- Dimensions: 1080×1920 (9:16)
- Length: 15-30 seconds optimal (under 90 max)
- Text: Within safe zones (top 250px, bottom 200px clear)
- Audio: Trending sounds boost reach 40%+

**Caption Structure**:
```
[HOOK - 1 line that stops the scroll]

[BODY - 2-3 short lines with value/story]

[CTA - Single clear action]

[HASHTAGS - 3-5, niche + location]
```

### TikTok (Entertainment-First Strategy)

**Algorithm Priorities**:
1. Watch time (complete views)
2. Replays
3. Shares
4. Comments
5. Likes

**Content Guidelines**:
- Hook MUST land in first 1-2 seconds
- Text on screen for silent viewing
- Vertical only (9:16)
- Trending audio = distribution boost
- Post 3-5x per week minimum

**Caption**: Short, punchy, include 1 question or CTA
**Hashtags**: 3-5 max, mix trending + niche

### Facebook (Community + Longer Form)

**What Works in 2025/26**:
- Reels crossposted from Instagram
- Photo albums (property tours)
- Longer video (1-3 minutes) for engaged audiences
- Link posts to direct booking site

**Audience**: Slightly older (35-65), family-focused, planners

**Caption Style**: Can be longer, more descriptive, story-focused

### YouTube Shorts (Search-Optimized)

**Key Difference**: YouTube Shorts are SEARCHABLE

**Title Strategy**:
- Include location + keyword
- Example: "Marathon FL Vacation Rental with Private Dock | House Tour"

**Description**: Full keyword-rich description (unlike TikTok)
