## Gemini 3 Pro (Nano Banana) — Primary Platform

Google's latest image generation with powerful multi-reference capabilities.

### Multi-Image Reference System (Game Changer)

Upload up to **14 reference images** to guide generation:

| Reference Type | What to Upload | Purpose |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Property photos** | 3-5 existing property shots | Match exact property style |
| **Brand images** | 2-3 VPVR branded graphics | Maintain brand consistency |
| **Mood references** | 2-3 aspirational images | Set emotional tone |
| **Composition examples** | 1-2 framing references | Guide layout |

### Conversational Prompting

Gemini works best with natural language, not keyword lists:

```
❌ "Florida Keys, pool, sunset, luxury, drone shot, 16:9"

✅ "Create a warm, inviting image of our Blue Pearl property at sunset.
   Show the pool in the foreground with the 70-foot dock extending
   toward the calm canal water. I want it to feel like a magazine cover
   for Coastal Living. Leave some space on the left for text overlay."
```

### Iterative Refinement

Ask for specific edits in follow-up prompts:
- "Make the water more turquoise"
- "Add more warm tones to the sunset"
- "Show the scene from a slightly higher angle"
- "Remove the clouds and make it a clear sky"

### Character Consistency (Lifestyle Shots)

For consistent people across a campaign:
1. Upload 2-3 reference images of desired "character type"
2. Describe character details once (age, style, vibe)
3. Use "same person" or "same couple" in subsequent prompts
4. Keep clothing/accessories consistent in descriptions

---

## The 8-Element Prompting Framework

Every effective AI image prompt includes these eight elements:

| Element | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. **Subject** | Main focus of the image | What viewers notice first |
| 2. **Composition** | How the shot is framed | Visual structure and balance |
| 3. **Action** | What's happening | Movement, life, story |
| 4. **Location** | Where the scene occurs | Context and setting |
| 5. **Style** | Aesthetic and mood | Visual consistency |
| 6. **Lighting** | Time of day, light quality | Emotional impact |
| 7. **Aspect Ratio** | Image dimensions | Platform optimization |
